part of redux_saga;

///  Spawns a `saga` on an action dispatched to the Store or the [channel] provided that matches [pattern].
///  After spawning a task it's still accepting incoming actions into the
///  underlying `buffer`, keeping at most 1 (the most recent one), but in the
///  same time holding up with spawning new task for [duration] (hence its name - `Throttle`).
///  Purpose of this is to ignore incoming actions for a given period of time while
///  processing a task.
///
///  - [duration] is length of a time window during which actions will be ignored after the
///  action starts processing.
///
///  - [pattern] is used to filter actions. Only matching actions will be processed. See docs for [Take].
///
///  - [saga] is a Generator function.
///
///  - [args] and [namedArgs] are arguments to be passed to the started task. `Throttle` will add the
///  incoming action to the argument list (i.e. the action will be a named `{dynamic action}` argument
///  provided to `saga`)
///
///  - If a [channel] is provided then actions will be put from provided channel.
///
///  - [Catch] will be invoked for uncaught errors.
///
///  - [Finally] will be invoked in any case before task execution is end.
///
///  - If [detached] is false `Throttle` will return a forked task, otherwise it will
///  return a spawned task. By default [detached] is false.
///
///  - [name] is an optional name for the task meta.
///
///  ### Example
///
///  In the following example, we create a basic task `fetchAutocomplete`.
///  We use `Throttle` to start a new `fetchAutocomplete` task on dispatched `FetchedAutocomplete`
///  action. However since `Throttle` ignores consecutive `FetchedAutocomplete` for some time,
///  we ensure that user won't flood our server with requests.
///
///```
///  import 'package:redux_saga/redux_saga.dart';
///  import 'Api.dart';
///
///  //...
///
///  fetchAutocomplete({dynamic action}) sync* {
///    var autocompleteProposals = Result();
///    yield Call(Api.fetchAutocomplete, args: [action.text]);
///    yield Put(FetchedAutocompleteProposals(proposals: autocompleteProposals));
///  }
///
///  throttleAutocomplete() sync* {
///    yield Throttle(
///      fetchAutocomplete,
///      duration: Duration(milliseconds: 1000),
///      pattern: FetchedAutocomplete,
///    );
///  }
///```
///
/// Note that, `Throttle` is a high-level API built using [Take], [Fork] and [ActionChannel].
