part of redux_saga;

///  Spawns a `saga` on an action dispatched to the Store or the [channel] provided that matches [pattern].
///  Saga will be called after it stops taking [pattern] actions for [duration].
///  Purpose of this is to prevent calling saga until the actions are settled off.
///
///  - [duration] defines how much delay should elapse since the last time
///  [pattern] action was fired to call the `saga`
///
///  - [pattern] is used to filter actions. Only matching actions will be processed. See docs for [Take].
///
///  - [saga] is a Generator function.
///
///  - [args] and [namedArgs] are arguments to be passed to the started task. `Debounce` will add the
///  incoming action to the argument list (i.e. the action will be a named `{dynamic action}` argument
///  provided to `saga`)
///
///  - If a [channel] is provided then actions will be put from provided channel.
///
///  - [Catch] will be invoked for uncaught errors.
///
///  - [Finally] will be invoked in any case before task execution is end.
///
///  - If [detached] is false `Debounce` will return a forked task, otherwise it will
///  return a spawned task. By default [detached] is false.
///
///  - [name] is an optional name for the task meta.
///
///  ### Example
///
///  In the following example, we create a basic task `fetchAutocomplete`. We use `debounce` to
///  delay calling `fetchAutocomplete` saga until we stop receive any `FetchedAutocomplete` events
///  for at least `1000` ms.
///
///```
///  import 'package:redux_saga/redux_saga.dart';
///  import 'Api.dart';
///
///  //...
///
///  fetchAutocomplete({dynamic action}) sync* {
///    var autocompleteProposals = Result();
///    yield Call(Api.fetchAutocomplete, args: [action.text]);
///    yield Put(FetchedAutocompleteProposals(proposals: autocompleteProposals));
///  }
///
///  debounceAutocomplete() sync* {
///    yield Debounce(
///      fetchAutocomplete,
///      duration: Duration(milliseconds: 1000),
///      pattern: FetchedAutocomplete,
///    );
///  }
///```
/// Note that, `debounce` is a high-level API built using [Take], [Delay], [Race] and [Fork].
